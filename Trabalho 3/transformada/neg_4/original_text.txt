Our last argument is how we want to approximate the
contour. We use v2. CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE to compress
horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments into their end-
points only. This saves both computation and memory. If
we wanted all the points along the contour, without com-
pression, we can pass in cv2 â€œCHAIN_APPROX_NONE; however,
be very sparing when using this function. Retrieving all
points along a contour is often unnecessary and is wasteful

of resources.
